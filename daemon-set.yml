# A DaemonSet ensures that a specific Pod runs on every (or selected) node in the cluster.
# It is typically used for deploying background or system-level tasks such as logging, monitoring, or networking components.
#
# Use Case:
# - Deploying log collectors like Fluentd to gather logs from all nodes.
# - Running node monitoring agents like Prometheus Node Exporter.
# - Managing network plugins such as CNI plugins.
